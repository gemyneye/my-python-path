#Python Journey

By: Dennis Breitwieser-Cutshall

Welcome! This repo tracks my hands-on learning journey as I develop Codemy skills in Python, GitHub, and Power Platform â€” with the goal of becoming a fully remote automation-focused developer by October 2025.

## 04/17 Current focus: 
- Python Fundamentals
- Continued growth in Power Platforms
- Learn and utilize Git/GitHub

### Started intro to Python with Mimo

### 04/22 Started learning Python with freecodecamp and Codemy. I knew nothing!

### 04/29 Learned while loop and coded FizzBuzz.
- need to practice a lot more

### 05/01 Learning more in Mimo
- more functions learned but nothing is sticking and 'Return' is confusing me but I will get this!
- utilize Mimo as an interactive familiarizaton, then codemy as practical learning and write in Sublime
