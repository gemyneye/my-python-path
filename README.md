# My Developer Learning Journey

This repository is where I'm documenting my progress as I learn Python, GitHub, and Power Platform development and throw in some zsh/bash.

## Python

I'm currently learning Python through hands-on practice.

-  [x] Hello World
-  [x] Variables, Data Types
-  [x] Loops & Functions
-  [x] Small Projects

##  Power Platform

I'm actively learning and applying Power Platform tools, especially in a work setting.

-  Built apps using Power Apps and SharePoint integration
-  Automating office processes with Power Automate
-  Troubleshooting Patch functions and lookup relationships
-  Building custom galleries and filters for internal tools
-  Exploring Power BI and model-driven apps (planned)

##  What’s in this repo

- `hello.py`: My first Python script
- `notes/`: Where I’m keeping personal learning notes
- `.gitignore`: Hides system/secret files from public view

##  Future Plans

- Start building small, real-world Python scripts
- Add more Power Apps project documentation
- Learn GitHub workflows (committing, pushing, cloning)

## Current status
- Actually also started Full Stack and have restarted HTML and 
- am on intermediate HTML with the new Full Stack on freeCodeCamp. 
- Also continuing Python by working with lists, dicts, sets, tuples and looping through them.
- Added use of list comprehensions (those are fun!)
